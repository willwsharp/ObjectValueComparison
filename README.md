# ObjectValueComparison
This class is for testing.  You can use it to determine if any two objects (provided they are of the same type) are equal using a value comparison instead of a reference comparison.  This is helpful because some testing frameworks do not allow you to perform value comparisons on objects unless you override the default equals method on the objects you are comparing.  This is annoying to do if you have a lot of objects or if you don't particularly care to do that.  It is recursive and will parse through all of an object's children, even if those children have nested objects or contain lists of nested objects.  This is written in c# but the logic is fairly simple and can be applied to any language realistically.
